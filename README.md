# Advent of Code 2024 - C++ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles, implemented in C++.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual series of coding puzzles that are released every day during the month of December. Each puzzle typically requires solving a problem using algorithms and data structures, providing a fun way to improve programming skills. This year, I am solving all the puzzles in C++.

## Repository Structure

- Each dayâ€™s solution will be contained in a separate folder, named `Day XX`, where `XX` is the day of the month (e.g., `Day 01`, `Day 02`, etc.).
- Each day's folder will contain:
  - The main C++ source file (`dayXX.cpp`)
  - A `Problem.md` file with instructions for that day's problem
  - Input files (`input.txt`) when necessary
  
## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjaroztegi/AOC_2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory for a specific day (e.g., `Day 1`):
   ```bash
   cd 'Day 1'
   ```

3. Compile the C++ code using `g++` (or another compiler of your choice):
   ```bash
   g++ -o main day1.cpp
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```
